# DVWA Web Application Security Assessment

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive web application security assessment conducted on **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)**.  
The purpose of this project is to understand, identify, and document common web vulnerabilities in a controlled and ethical lab environment.

The assessment focuses on **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, mapped against the **OWASP Top 10** security risks.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To set up and explore a vulnerable web application (DVWA)
- To manually identify common web application vulnerabilities
- To understand real-world attack behavior in a safe environment
- To document vulnerabilities with clear steps, payloads, and evidence
- To recommend appropriate remediation techniques

---

## 🧪 Application Under Test
- **Name:** Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
- **Purpose:** Security testing and learning platform
- **Security Level Used:** Low
- **Hosting Method:** Docker (Localhost)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- DVWA
- Docker
- Web Browser (Firefox / Chromium)
- Burp Suite (for request analysis – optional)
- Manual testing techniques

---

## 🔍 Vulnerabilities Tested

### 1️⃣ SQL Injection
- Authentication bypass
- Data extraction through malicious SQL queries
- Impact: Unauthorized database access

### 2️⃣ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Reflected XSS
- Stored XSS
- Impact: JavaScript execution in victim browser

### 3️⃣ Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Forced password change using malicious HTML page
- Impact: Account takeover

---

## 🧭 Methodology
1. Application setup and configuration
2. Security level adjustment
3. Manual vulnerability testing
4. Payload-based exploitation
5. Impact analysis
6. OWASP Top 10 mapping
7. Documentation with screenshots and remediation

## 📊 OWASP Top 10 Mapping
| Vulnerability | OWASP Category |
|---------------|---------------|
| SQL Injection | A03 – Injection |
| XSS           | A07 – Cross-Site Scripting |
| CSRF          | A01 – Broken Access Control |

---

## 📸 Evidence & Documentation
Each vulnerability folder contains:
- Step-by-step testing procedure
- Payloads used during testing
- Screenshots as proof of exploitation
- Remediation recommendations

---

## ⚠️ Ethical Disclaimer
This project was conducted **strictly for educational and academic purposes** on a deliberately vulnerable application.  
No real-world systems or unauthorized targets were tested.

---

## 📘 Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of common web vulnerabilities
- Hands-on experience with vulnerability exploitation
- Knowledge of secure coding practices
- Familiarity with OWASP Top 10 risks
